This repository is dedicated to the implementation and demonstration of advanced quantum algorithms using Qiskit, an open-source quantum computing framework by IBM. It serves as a comprehensive learning resource for enthusiasts, students, and researchers interested in exploring practical applications of quantum computing beyond the basic gate operations.
The collection includes five major algorithms, each highlighting a different aspect of quantum mechanics and computational advantage:

1.Quantum Teleportation – Demonstrates the transmission of an unknown quantum state from one location to another without physically moving the particle, leveraging the phenomenon of entanglement and classical communication.

2.Superdense Coding – Illustrates how two classical bits of information can be communicated using just one qubit, provided the communicating parties share an entangled pair beforehand, showcasing the efficiency of quantum communication protocols.

3.Grover’s Search Algorithm – Provides a quadratic speed-up for unstructured search problems compared to classical methods, implemented with a focus on oracle construction and amplitude amplification.

4.Shor’s Algorithm – Explores the potential of quantum computers to factor large integers exponentially faster than classical algorithms, underlining its significance in cryptography and security.

5.Deutsch–Jozsa Algorithm – An early example of quantum advantage, solving the problem of determining whether a function is constant or balanced in a single evaluation, compared to multiple evaluations required classically.
